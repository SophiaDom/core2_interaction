    <p>The average person can recall or recognize 5,000 faces, the median of a range of 1,000-10,000.</p>
    <p>This number may appear large but with personal relationships, colleagues, pupils, friends, neighbors, professors, bosses, actresses, musicians, influencers, businessmen, politicians, artists, etc. the number grows large quickly.</p>
    <p>Through overconsumption of media, we subconsciously replace the face of our childhood best friend for a newly introduced character on a television show.</p>
    <p>The lifestyle you consume rightfully reflects in your brain's recognition.</p>
    <p>This experience, Phaces, serves to be documentation of faces that I wish not to forget regardless of the personal connection I have to them. The faces are displayed in a stylistic way reflective of continual line street art portraits to disguise and allude to the neglection of identity through memory. Each person I meet I can synthesize into a color and shape which are included in pair with the portraits that have a more personal connection.</p>
    <p>Who would be among your library of faces?</p>
    <p>Who have you forgotten?</p>
