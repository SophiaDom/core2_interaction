    <div class="pfirst"><p>Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone
        is tired of hearing there are </p><div class="blackout"><p>one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for
        snow.</p></div> <p>This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: </p> <br><h3>Some languages are so constructed—English among
        them—that </h3><div class="blackout"><h3>we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</h3></div><br><p> That sentence begins with your first words,
        toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a
        nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who
        knows you and loves you and will be sorry</p><div class="blackout"><p> to hear the sentence end.</p></div></div>
        <br><br>
       <div class="psecond"> <p>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely
        right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use
        a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be
        thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that
        allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of
        keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart.</p>
       <div class="indent"><h3>Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if
        it were not for the poem that intervenes,</h3><div class="blackout"><h3> the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.</h3> </div>
    </div>
        <p>Would not speak to each other. Because the </p><div class="blackout"><p>lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they
        to you.</p></div>
