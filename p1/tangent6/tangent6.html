    <p>Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this:<br> “Perhaps all we can
        say,<br> and even this may be too much,<br> is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our
        experiences,<br> and that</p> <h3>the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created<br> are also
        released.</h3><br> <p>Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those
        expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”</p>
