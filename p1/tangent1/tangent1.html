    <div class="first"><p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that...<br> no poem is ever ended, <br> that every poem is merely
        abandoned.<br> This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</p></div>
        <div class="second"><p>Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have
        never forgotten it:</p><br><h3>the opening line of a poem,<br> he said, <br>is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>a piece of
        fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would
        fall.</h3></div>
