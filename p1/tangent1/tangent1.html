    <div class="first"><p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that</p>
        <h3>no poem is ever ended,that every poem is merely abandoned. </h3> 
        <p>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="second"><p>Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have
        never forgotten it:</p>
        <h3>the opening line of a poem [...] is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of
        fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would
        fall.</h3></div>
