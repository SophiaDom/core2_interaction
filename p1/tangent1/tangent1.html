    <div class="pfirst"><p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that</p>
        <h3>no poem is ever ended,</h3><div class="blackout"><h3> that every poem is merely abandoned</h3></div> 
        <p>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a </p><div class="blackout"><p>cloud.</p></div>

        never forgotten it:</p>
        <h3>the opening line of a poem [...] is like </h3><div class="blackout"><h3>finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of
        fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would
        fall.</h3></div></div><br><br>
