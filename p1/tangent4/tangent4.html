    <p>The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper:</p><br> <h3>“The image cannot be disposed of a
        primordial freshness which </h3><div class="blackout"><h3>ideas can never claim.”</h3></div>
        <p>Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of </p><div class="blackout"><p>his drawings and paintings,
        usually poetry, usually Dante.</p></div><p> Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see
        expressed in Twombly’s work.</p>
