    <p>The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper:</p><br> <h3>“The image cannot be disposed of a
        primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”</h3>
        <p>Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings,
        usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see
        expressed in Twombly’s work.</p>
