    <p>Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: <br>the ending will have the last
        word <br>or the ending will be silent <br>or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly
        incongruent.
        <br>
        Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: </p><h3>We begin in admiration and we end by
        organizing our disappointment.</h3><p> The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and
        fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its
        dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through
        familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.
        <br>
        I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you
        are conceding that</p><h3> in the beginning was the act, not the word.</h3>
